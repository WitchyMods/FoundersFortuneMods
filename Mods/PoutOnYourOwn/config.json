[h1]Description[/h1]
When having a Lazy Day or Burnout, colonist will no longer disturb others with constant social interactions.
They will instead either Relax, Sit, Dance or Enjoy Fire.

They might still however decide to do a regular social interaction if it is their first one after becoming Lazy or Burnout.
This is because this mod changes the method to get the next possible automated interaction.
