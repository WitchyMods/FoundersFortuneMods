[h1]Description[/h1]
Colonist will always do tasks according to their profession priorities (number of stars). If two professions have the same priority, they have equal chances to be selected.
Ever since the last update (13.0.09), tasks are no longer done in order of profession priorities.
Instead, there's a bit of randomization in the logic.
For those of you who prefer to always have 3 stars task be done before 2 stars tasks and so on, this mod is for you!

[h1]New in 2.2.0[/h1]
[list]
[*]Farmers will no longer sow/harvest/water many plots in a row before choosing an other task.  They will do tasks in order of distance.
This means that farmers will harvest a tile and re-sow it immediately then water it which makes them way more efficient.
[*]Foresters will no longer go after either all trees or stumps before going to the next task.  They will select the nearest tree/stump to chop down.
[*]Doctors now bury dead tikis/pirates automatically as long as there are empty graves.  If no empty graves remain, no alert will be displayed for non-colonist bodies.
[/list]

[h1]NEW FEATURE![/h1]
From version 2.0 and onwards, you can now order each specialization (Sub task of a profession).
This means that, for example, if you want a Miner to focus on Iron first, move the 'Mine Iron' specialization to the top!

Farmers will now focus on the resource you have the less of when tending fields or cooking.
For example, if you have a capacity for raw food of 100 and have 50 tomatoes but no potatoes, they'll harvest and sow the potatoes first!

This mod completely rewrites the mechanics of the game when getting work interactions.
This means that mods which add specializations must patch the methods of this mod in order to work.
Check out the code for my BuildAsProfessionTask in order to know how!
