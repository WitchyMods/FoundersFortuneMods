[h1]Description[/h1]
Removes the check for time of the day for going to bed.
In the vanilla game, if it is night and a colonist has less than 50% energy, they will go to bed.
With this mod, colonists will only go to bed if they have less than 15% energy.
If no bed is available, they will only sleep on ground if they are completely exhausted.
