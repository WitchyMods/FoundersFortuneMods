[h1]Description[/h1]
When colonists are ready for a child, instead of automatically spawning a new child and asking you to name it, the game will allow you to decline or accept their wish to have a new child.
The text of the 'New child' window has been changed to indicate that the parents are THINKING about having a new child so it doesn't sound so murdery :)
