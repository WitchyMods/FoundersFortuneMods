[h1]Description[/h1]
Adds 'Build' as a task under each profession. 
If turned off, your colonist will not build structures or furniture automatically (but they can still be ordered to).

[b]Note[/b]: Now that it is a task under each professions, if a colonist does not have a profession, they will not automatically build anything. This can be confusing when starting a new game.

[b]Note2[/b]: Due to the mechanics of the job priorities since the latest version, if your 3 stars profession does not have 'Build' enabled but your 2 stars profession does, your colonist may 
still end up building even if they have available tasks to do for their 3 stars job.

[h1]Changelog[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]1.1.0[/b]: Compatibility with AbsoluteProfessionPriorities mod 2.0
[*][b]1.0.1[/b]: Increased priority of the Build task so colonist will Build first before doing something else.
